The Human Resource Management System (HRM) is an integrated software solution designed to manage the complete employee lifecycle in a closed-loop process, from recruitment, employee records management, time and attendance tracking, payroll and benefits administration, to performance evaluation and training. The system centralizes human resource data and standardizes HR processes to improve efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making within the organization. It consists of five core modules: Recruitment (ATS) for managing hiring activities, Core HR for maintaining employee profiles and contracts, Time & Attendance for tracking working hours and leave, Compensation & Benefits for payroll, insurance, and tax management, and Evaluation & Training for performance assessment and employee development. From a system context perspective, the HRM system interacts with key external actors such as HR staff, employees, managers, and external payroll, insurance, and government tax systems. The system boundary and data flows defined in the context diagram illustrate how information is exchanged between the HRM system and these external entities, while ensuring scalability and future integration with other enterprise systems such as ERP and accounting platforms.
